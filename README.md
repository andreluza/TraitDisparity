### Appendix S2

In this document we report supplementary results (mostly sensitivity
analysis) of our manuscript. The figures and tables presented here
follow the same order and settings as the ones shown in the main text:

1 - The table with GLM coefficients showing differences in the slope of
SES disparity \~ SES MPD between empirical and simulated disparity.
Similar to Table 1.

2 - The relationship between SES MPD (Mean Pairwise (phylogenetic)
Distance between species) and SES disparity produced by the empirical
data set of skull morphology, and three data sets generated by trait
simulation (Brownian motion\[BM\], Early-Burst\[EB\], and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck \[OU\]). Similar to Fig. 2 in the main text.

3 - A panel of five maps of A) empirical morphological disparity, B)
disparity compared to a null model, C) disparity compared to a BM
evolutionary model, D) significance of the map B, E) significance of the
map C. Similar to Fig. 3 in the main text.

4 - A panel comprising four maps, showing the disparity expected by i) a
null model, ii) BM model, iii) EB model, iv) OU model. Similar to Fig. 4
in the main text. We show the correlation between these expectations as
a separate table after the map.

The values of parameters, estimated through macroevolutionary models
(using ‘fitContinuous’ in univariate datasets, and ‘mvgls’ in
multivariate datasets), are only presented here in the supporting
information.

#### Results, considering the complete set of species, and using the complete sample of 100 fully resolved phylogenies from Upham et al. (2019) (i.e., considering phylogenetic uncertainty). The following figures are supplementary to Figs. 2 to 5, and tables 1 and 2 presented in the main text.

Fig. S2.3. Density plot showing the estimates of each model parameters
for univariate and multivariate models. In the top we show the estimates
of the parameter ‘sigma’ for the BM, EB, and OU models of evolution
(evolutionary models for univariate trait data (fitContinuous)). In the
middle, we show the parameters ‘beta’ and ‘alpha’, which are specific
from EB and OU, respectively (evolutionary models for univariate trait
data (fitContinuous)). In the bottom, we show estimates of sigma for the
BM model (evolutionary models for multivariate trait data (mvGLS)). In
univariate models, the density represents variation in estimates across
the 100 fully resolved phylogenies. In the multivariate model, the
density represents variation of sigma across traits and phylogenies (112
simulated ‘landmarks’ and 100 fully resolved phylogenies).Results
produced by using the dataset of 413 species.

Below we present a table of GLM coefficients that considers phylogenetic
uncertainty when testing which model produced a simulated disparity
closer to the empirical disparity (results alternative to Table 1 in the
main text) show that the disparity simulated by the OU model gets closer
to the empirical disparity (Table S2.1). The GLM estimates were averaged
(and its standard deviation calculated) across 100 runs per phylogeny
(for 100 fully resolved phylogenies).

### Analysis with 216 species, and considering phylogenetic uncertainty

Using this data subset, the estimated parameters of macroevolutionary
models were very similar to those estimated for the complete set of
species (compare Figs. S2.1 and S2.2). we then produced a bivariate plot
describing the relationship between SES disparity and SES MPD, for the
empirical and simulated data sets. We found that this relationship (Fig.
S2.3) was similar to the one reported in the main results (Fig. 2).
Overall, the disparity produced by the OU model had a closer
relationship with the empirical disparity than had the other models of
evolution (BM and EB) (Fig. S2.3).

<img src="README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Fig. S2.4.Density plot showing the estimates of each model parameters
for univariate and multivariate models. In the top we show the estimates
of the parameter ‘sigma’ for the BM, EB, and OU models of evolution
(evolutionary models for univariate trait data (fitContinuous)). In the
middle, we show the parameters ‘beta’ and ‘alpha’, which are specific
from EB and OU, respectively (evolutionary models for univariate trait
data (fitContinuous)). In the bottom, we show estimates of sigma for the
BM model (evolutionary models for multivariate trait data (mvGLS)). In
univariate models, the density represents variation in estimates across
the 100 fully resolved phylogenies. In the multivariate model, the
density represents variation of sigma across traits and phylogenies (112
simulated ‘landmarks’ and 100 fully resolved phylogenies).Results
produced by using the dataset of 216 species.

As presented in the results (mapping section), we counted the number of
cells with values of disparity higher, equal, or lower than the null
model (randomization-based null model, NULL) and the evolutionary
models. We found that 364 communities had a disparity lower than
expected by the EB and OU models, and 344 communities had a disparity
lower than the BM model. Nonetheless, only three communities had
disparity lower than the null disparity. On the other hand, 182
communities had disparity higher than the expected by the OU model, 138,
129, and 90 communities had disparity higher than the expected by the
BM, EB and NULL models.

When mapping the values of empirical and simulated trait values, we
found a high agreement between the complete dataset and the dataset with
216 species (Fig. S2.4). Overall, we found a prevalence of higher
disparity than expected by an OU model in two portions of the Atlantic
Rainforest, and lower disparity than expected by an OU model in Amazon,
Northeastern Brazil, and south Andes.

Finally, we show the maps of null and simulated disparity (Fig. S2.5).
We found that using a null model is quite similar to simulating a trait
using the OU model. This can be seen in the following map (and the
correlations presented after the Fig. S2.5), where the null disparity
and the disparity produced by the OU model produced quite similar,
highly correlated maps (0.96, Table below the map). The correlation was
also high between Null and BM disparity.

### Results for subclade Oryzomyalia, considering phylogenetic uncertainty

Bivariate plot similar to Fig. 2. This is very similar to the plots
reported in the main text and sensitivity analysis with 216 species
(just presented). However, the main difference is that we lost values of
SES MPD higher than zero, as now we lost phylogenetic distances by using
only data from the subclade Oryzomyalia.

Fig. S2.8. Density plot showing the estimates of each model parameters
for univariate and multivariate models. In the top we show the estimates
of the parameter ‘sigma’ for the BM, EB, and OU models of evolution
(evolutionary models for univariate trait data (fitContinuous)). In the
middle, we show the parameters ‘beta’ and ‘alpha’, which are specific
from EB and OU, respectively (evolutionary models for univariate trait
data (fitContinuous)). In the bottom, we show estimates of sigma for the
BM model (evolutionary models for multivariate trait data (mvGLS)). In
univariate models, the density represents variation in estimates across
the 100 fully resolved phylogenies. In the multivariate model, the
density represents variation of sigma across traits and phylogenies (112
simulated ‘landmarks’ and 100 fully resolved phylogenies). Results
produced by using the dataset of Oryzomyalia species.

Counting the number of cells. We found that 269 communities had a
disparity lower than expected by the OU model, 262 had a disparity lower
than expected by the EB model, and 247 communities had a disparity lower
than the BM model. Nonetheless, no community had disparity lower than
the null disparity. On the other hand, 109 communities had disparity
higher than the expected by the NULL model, and only 19, 18 and 16
communities had disparity higher than the expected by the the OU, BM and
EB models of evolution.

The maps of observed and simulated disparity still resemble the ones
shown in Fig. 3 (main text), and the ones just reported considering 216
species (Fig. S2.4). However, less communities had significantly lower
and higher disparity than the disparity expected by the OU model (Fig.
S2.9).

Finally, we report high correlation between null and simulated disparity
(map similar to Fig. 4, and Fig. S2.3 presented above).

Correlations between maps were similar to the ones reported in the main
text and in the previous analyses (the highest correlation was found
between NULL and OU-simulated disparity.

Maps similar to Fig. 3, and to maps just reported considering the

Assemblages presenting lower disparity than predicted by a BM model of
evolution were located at the Chaco, Amazon Basin, north Brazil, South
Andes and Patagonia (Fig. S3.2).
